# yamlerSL
C++ Program for parsing and converting a limited subset of YAML into memory to be used.

⚠ WARNING ⚠
This is a primitive prototype to make a proof of concept parser which was used in a finals coursework. It is by no means a reliable parser made for industrial use, featuring many compromises and drawbacks inside of the algorithm to make the proof of concept work. Use and modify to your own discretion
